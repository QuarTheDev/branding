<h3 align="center">üèÖ Primary Logo</h3>

<p align="center">The primary logo for "Quar" is a modern, minimalist representation of the letter "Q." It features a bold, hollow circle with a gap in the 4th quadrant. Within this gap, a smaller dot completes the ‚ÄòQ‚Äô form. The design uses clean, monochrome colors and a heavy emphasis on geometry, making it visually simple, yet remaining striking and easy to recognize. This logo was designed with professionalism and modernity in mind.</p>
<p align="center">The logo's core design is meant to symbolize the balance between individuality and community. The small dot represents the individual (you), while the larger, open circle represents the collective (everyone). It's meant to reflect how each person is a part of a bigger picture. It‚Äôs intended to be a reminder that while we each have our unique roles, we all contribute to something larger than ourselves.</p>
